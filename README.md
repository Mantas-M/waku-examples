# Decentralized chat example using Waku

1. Waku - Has nodes like a blockchain, nodes are connected to eachother and are used to send messages
   messages are sent into content topics that are like channels where the nodes push messages or listen
   for messages

2. Public & Private keys - Private keys for decoding messages, and public keys for encoding messages

3. Signing - user can sign a message with his wallet and we can verify that the message was sent by the
   exact wallet which signed the message

4. App state - the state of the application is that a trip has been created and we have it's data
   thats how we get the wallet addresses of the guest and host

5. Structure - Admin is our service and clients are on the frontend
